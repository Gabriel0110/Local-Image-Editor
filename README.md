# Local Image Editor

Local Image Editor is a powerful desktop application that provides advanced image editing capabilities, including inpainting, depth-wise background removal, and more. This project also includes AI-powered tools like EdgeSAM and Stable Diffusion for state-of-the-art image manipulation.

## Features

- **Image Editing**: Crop, rotate, and adjust images with ease.
- **Inpainting**: Fill in missing parts of images using AI models.
- **Depth-Wise Background Removal**: Remove backgrounds based on depth information.
- **GIF Editing**: Add text, images, and layers to GIFs.
- **AI Models Integration**: EdgeSAM for advanced segmentation and Stable Diffusion for inpainting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **CMake (version 3.10 or higher)**
- **Python (version 3.8 or higher)**
- **Git**
- **A C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang)**
- **Qt5, OpenCV, and OpenGL**

### Build Instructions
Follow these steps to build and run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Local-Image-Editor.git
cd Local-Image-Editor
```

2. Configure and build the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

3. Set up the virtual environment:

The build process will automatically create a Python virtual environment named local-image-editor-venv. It will install all necessary Python dependencies.

4. Clone and set up EdgeSAM:

The build process will also clone the EdgeSAM project, install its dependencies, and set it up for use. The EdgeSAM repository and its models will be stored in the resources/models/EdgeSAM/ directory.

5. Download Stable Diffusion Inpainting model:

The build process will download the Stable Diffusion inpainting model and store it in the resources/models/stable-diffusion-inpainting/ directory.

6. Run the application

Once the build is complete, you can run the application:

```bash
./MediaEditor
```

## Advanced Configuration
If you need to customize the build process (e.g., specify a different Python version or additional flags), you can modify the CMakeLists.txt file as needed.

### Installing Dependencies Manually
If you need to install the Python dependencies manually, activate the virtual environment and install the requirements:

```bash
source build/local-image-editor-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r resources/scripts/requirements.txt
pip install -r build/EdgeSAM/requirements.txt
```
