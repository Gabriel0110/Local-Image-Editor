# Local Image Editor

Local Image Editor is a powerful desktop application that provides advanced image editing capabilities (if desired - need the models locally). This project is based on Yacine's Dingboard (dingboard.com) - I like to call it Fingboard (Fake Dingboard).

## Features

- **Image Editing**: Crop, rotate, and adjust images with ease.
- **Inpainting**: Fill in missing parts of images using AI models.
- **Depth-Wise Background Removal**: Remove backgrounds based on depth information.
- **GIF Editing (IN-PROGRESS)**: Add text, images, and layers to GIFs.
- **AI Models Integration**: EdgeSAM for advanced segmentation and Stable Diffusion for inpainting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **CMake (version 3.10 or higher)**
- **Python (version 3.8 or higher)**
- **Git**
- **A C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang)**
- **Qt5, OpenCV, and OpenGL**

### Build Instructions
Follow these steps to build and run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Local-Image-Editor.git
cd Local-Image-Editor
```

2. Configure and build the project:

#### On Linux/MacOS
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### On Windows
If you are using Visual Studio 2022 (or any other version), you need to specify the generator and the architecture:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- **Note: Replace "Visual Studio 17 2022" with the appropriate version, unless you are using a different generator (e.g. Ninja, etc.) then replace that entire piece with the generator of your choice. Also be sure to build for your system's architecture (x32/x64).**

3. Set up the virtual environment:

The build process will automatically create a Python virtual environment named local-image-editor-venv. It will install all necessary Python dependencies.

4. Clone and set up EdgeSAM:

The build process will also clone the EdgeSAM project, install its dependencies, and set it up for use. The EdgeSAM repository and its models will be stored in the resources/models/EdgeSAM/ directory.

5. Download Stable Diffusion Inpainting model:

The build process will download the Stable Diffusion inpainting model and store it in the resources/models/stable-diffusion-inpainting/ directory.

6. Run the application

Once the build is complete, you can run the application:

#### On Linux/MacOS
```bash
./MediaEditor
```

#### On Windows
```bash
MediaEditor.exe
```

## Advanced Configuration
If you need to customize the build process (e.g., specify a different Python version or additional flags), you can modify the CMakeLists.txt file as needed.

### Installing Dependencies Manually
If you need to install the Python dependencies manually, activate the virtual environment and install the requirements:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source build/local-image-editor-venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/MacOS
# OR
build\local-image-editor-venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install the main requirements
pip install -r resources/scripts/requirements.txt

# Install EdgeSAM requirements
pip install -r build/EdgeSAM/requirements.txt
```
